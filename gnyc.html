        <h2>Why Should We Care?</h2>
        <p>A lot of people wonder why they should even care and to be honest I used feel the same. however I realize that i keep complaining about the hot temperature or the really cold temperature caused by global warming whichn humans are the biggest factors in. I wanted a change in the environment and the only way to that was to start the change myself. You feel as much Pride as I do this is your time to make a difference. </p>
